Lab instructors facilitate this process by guiding students through the demands of each of the labs. Lab instructors are there to help you, so ask them questions when you need answers! 1.1 Lab structure: Major and mini projects, and presentations The entire semester is divided into three major projects, and 3 mini projects. They are ordered consecutively to build upon skills. For example, the first projects focus on data analysis skills involving t-tests, then one-way ANOVAs, and finally 2x2 Factorial designs. Throughout each of the labs you will learn how to create experiments and conducts analyses on the data. Then you will employ these skills in the last half of the semester when you form groups and conduct, analyze, report and present an experiment of your own design. 1.2 Major projects Each major project involves students completing an experiment as a class (using themselves as subjects to collect data). Students will learn about the conceptual issues behind the experiment, collect data on themselves, and analyze the class data using appropriate statistics. Each student will then be responsible for writing a short (5+ page) APA style report about the project. The first two major projects involve predefined experiments that the class completes. These two projects are roughly finished mid-semester, and are intended to train students in the skills needed to complete the final project. The last major project is the final project, where students form groups and complete an experiment based on their own design. Each lab instructor is responsible for grading each of their students papers. Individual lab instuctors will explain to their sections how their grading scheme will work. 1.3 Mini projects In the first half of the semester, each of the weeks that does not introduce a new major project are reserved for mini-projects. These projects are intended to be completed within one lab session. Each of the mini-projects involve 1) reading and understanding a primary source, and 2) attempting to replicate the result in the paper. These are graded on a pass/fail basis, where a pass is given to students who show up and participate in the lab (regardless of whether their experiment turns out.) 1.4 Presentations The final project involves two presentations. An individual presentation, and a group presentation. Prior to forming groups for the final project, each student will give a short (2-3) minute pitch for their project idea. Then, students will form groups (choose one of the members project ideas, or generate a new one) and begin working on their final project. The last lab is reserved for the group presentations where each group gives a 10 minute research presentation. 1.5 Grading Each lab instructor will grade the work of the students in their sections. See the course syllabus for information on how each of the lab components weigh into the final grade for the course. 1.6 Lab Resources There are many resources to help you complete the lab assignments. These are included in this lab manual, as well as online. 1.7 Website As much as possible all of the information for this course will be posted on the course website: http://crumplab.github.io/courses/experimental/ 1.8 Lab rooms There should be one computer per student in each of the lab rooms. These computers should have SPSS, Excel, Office, R, Superlab, LIVECODE, and Psychopy installed on them. 1.9 Lab manual This lab manual contains instructions for each the lab assignments, as well as helpful tutorials for learning skills to analyze and report data. 1.10 Lab Schedule 1.10.1 Lab 1: Overview Meet and greet your instructor and fellow classmates, and learn about what is in store for the labs this semester a. You will write three APA style research reports. Papers 1 and 2 will be on predefined projects, and Paper 3 will be based on a final project where students form groups to complete an experiment of their own design b. The final project will involve two presentations, an individual presentation and a group presentation. c. The first half of the semester involves completing Papers 1 and 2, and a few mini-projects that occur between papers 1 and 2. These will build the skills necessary to complete the final project which will take up most of the second half of the semester Students are expected to show up and be on time for labs Ask questions Go over QALMRI method using provided QALMRI materials Discuss/Review the components of writing an APA paper 1.10.2 Lab 2: Paper project 1 Students replicate the results of Song and Schwarz (2008) (2008)Song and Schwarz (2008).

["qalmri.html", "Chapter 2 QALMRI 2.1 The QALMRI Method 2.2 Writing a QALMRI 2.3 Example QALMRI 2.4 Finding the QALMRI sections in a journal article 2.5 The Hardest Section of the QALRMI: Alternatives", " Chapter 2 QALMRI The general goal of this course is to give you experience with the scientific process of asking and answering psychological questions. At the end of the course you should gain at least two kinds of skills. First, in the labs you will learn to ask and answer your own questions by conducting, analyzing, and reporting the results of experiments that you conduct. Second, you learn how understand the research literature, where other researchers have asked and answered questions, and communicated them publicly by publishing journal articles on their research. There are a lot of details involved in asking and answering questions in science, and you can easily see these details on display by reading any published peer-review journal article. You will become very familiar these details as you read more papers, and as you write your own APA style research reports. The details can be daunting, mainly because the format and structure of articles may be unfamiliar, and the language that scientists use is often very specific (or jargony). As a result, if you are not already an expert in a particular domain, it can be very difficult to read and understand research presented in journal articles. Furthermore, if you do not understand the concepts behind the questions, and the details behind the methods and results, then it is difficult to write your own research reports about experiments that you conduct. Have no fear, this lab manual is here to guide you through the process. Ultimately, by learning the skills we teach you throughout this semester, you will be able to critically evaluate your own research, as well as the research literature at large. This will allow you form your own opinions about the process of asking and answering questions. For example, when you learn how to critically evaluate research you will be able to: Evaluate whether or not you should believe particular scientific claims, or claims made by the media about new “research findings” Look at the evidence to see whether it actually provides an answer to the question that was being asked Look at the questions to see if they are good ones, and learn how to ask better questions Understand how theories and hypotheses work and make predictions about psychological phenomena Learn how to find scientific research that has been conducted on topics of your own interest, and then evaluate the claims and evidence for yourself. For example, the skills you learn here about evaluating psychological research are the same skills that you would need to evaluate medical research. So, if you are wondering whether a particular medical procedure, or drug, or diet works or doesn’t work, then you can read the research for yourself to arrive at your own informed opinion. 2.1 The QALMRI Method The first step is learning how to read journal articles. We will use the QALMRI method throughout this course as a tool to help you identify the major ideas and findings presented in journal articles. The major aspects of the QALMRI method will also help you identify whether your own research reports contain the information necessary to communicate your own research. First, we will explain the QALMRI method, then we will explain how you will be asked to use it throughout the course. The QALMRI method provides a means for critically evaluating experiments, as well as for organizing your own experiment proposals. It helps you to find connections between theory and data by making explicit the question being asked, the approach used to answer it, and the implications of the answer. QALMRI is an acronym, and each letter identifies critical parts of research articles. 2.1.1 Q stands for Question All research begins with a question, and the point of the research is to answer it. For example, we can ask whether a placebo is better than no action in alleviating depression. For most journal articles, the General Introduction should tell the reader what question the article is addressing, and why it is important enough that anyone should care about the answer. Questions fall into two categories: broad and specific. In your QALMRI, state both the broad and the specific questions being asked. Broad questions are typically too general to answer in a single experiment, although one should view the experiment as one step on a journey to answer the broad question. An example of a broad question might be “Does language influence perception?” This sort of question provides the general topic of the paper, and can only be answered through compiling many experimental results. In contrast, the specific question can typically be addressed in a single experiment or set of experiments. A specific question might be “If one language has a specific term for one color, and another language does not have any term for that color, will speakers of the two languages perceive the color differently?” Again, be sure to identify the broad and specific question relevant to your data collection. 2.1.2 A stands for Alternatives Good experiments consider at least 2 possible alternative answers to a specific question, and explains why both answers are plausible. For example, the possibility that speakers of different languages will perceive colors differently is plausible based on evidence that top-down processes can affect perception. The alternative hypothesis, that language does not influence perception of color, is also plausible because color perception in particular might be impervious to top-down influences. That is, it might be based solely on properties of the visual system which are unaffected by language. When describing an existing article or when proposing an experiment, you should identify the alternatives the authors considered. There are always at least 2 alternatives: that factor X will show an effect, or that it won’t (that a null result will be obtained). If possible, identify other alternative patterns as well. 2.1.3 L stands for Logic The logic of the study identifies how the experiment’s design will allow the experimenter to distinguish among the alternatives. The logic is typically explained towards the end of the study’s introduction, and has the following structure: If alternative 1 (and not alternative 2) is correct, then when a particular variable is manipulated, the participants’ behavior should change in a certain way. For example, the logic of the color experiment would be: If a person’s native language influences their perception of color, then speakers who have a term for a given color should respond differently to that color than speakers whose language contains no term for that color. Alternatively, if language does not influence color perception, then speakers who have a color term should respond no differently than speakers who lack the term. Note that the logic of the experiment is integrally connected to the alternatives you stated in the last section. Indeed, this section should be comprised of a series of “If, then” statements in which you restate the alternatives you offered (“If X,”), and then state what pattern of data would support that alternative (“then Y”). You should therefore have equal numbers of alternatives and If…then statements. 2.1.4 M stands for Method This section identifies the procedures that will be used to implement the logical design. It should state the independent variable (the factor being experimentally manipulated) and the dependent variable (the behavior being measured) of the experiment. It should also describe the subjects, including whether subjects were divided into groups receiving different experimental manipulations. What materials were used to conduct the experiment, and what were the experimental stimuli like? 2.1.5 R stands for Results What was the outcome of the experiment? Describe the results of the primary measures of interest. For example, did different subject groups yield different group means? What were these means? Or did the entire subject population produce a distinctive pattern of responses? Describe that pattern. Did the results seem reliable, or do you feel they might have been an artifact of the way the experiment was conducted? For this section, it is often a good idea to use graphs or tables to illustrate the pattern of data you obtained. 2.1.6 I stands for Inferences What can the results of the experiment tell us about the alternatives? If the study was well designed, the results should allow you to eliminate at least one of the possible alternatives. For example, if a language lacks a color word but the speakers of that language respond to the color no differently than speakers of a language lacking a term for the color, then the experiment supports the view that language does not influence color perception. At this point, take a step back and think about any potential problems with the experiment that could have led to the pattern of results you obtained. Were there confounds that could have caused the results? For example, if you did find a difference between the subject groups, are there other ways in which the groups differ that are not language-related? Might this have caused the result? Were there problems during the data collection? In addition, this is the section in which to consider the hypothetical next step in answering the broad question. If you were to conduct a follow-up experiment, what would it be (hint: think of questions that remain unanswered by the present results, and sketch a study that could bear on one or more of those questions)? What questions do your results raise? 2.2 Writing a QALMRI Writing a QALMRI for any research paper (one that you are writing, or one that you are reading) is simply writing short answers to each of these questions using clear and concise language. It is a condensed, short-form, version of the research. To be even more specific, your task is to answer these questions: Question: What was the broad question? What was the specific question? Alternative hypotheses: What were the hypotheses? Logic: If hypothesis 1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? What was the predicted outcome if hypothesis 2 was true? Method: What was the experimental design? Results: What was the pattern of data? Inferences: What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data? What can be concluded about the specific and broad question? What are the next steps? In many of the weekly labs you will read a primary research article, and then write your own QALMRI summary. This will help you extract the big ideas and findings from the research. You will also discuss your QALMRIs as a group to make sure that everyone is on the same page about what the research was about, and what the research showed. 2.3 Example QALMRI Even if you haven’t read the article, reading a QALMRI should provide you with enough information to get a basic idea of what the article was about. The following QALMRI summarizes the article by Crump &amp; Logan (2010). Crump and Logan (2010) 2.3.1 What was the broad and specific question? The broad questions are about spatial cognition. How do people understand and represent the spatial relationships between objects in the environment? Do people have “spatial maps” in their head? The specific question is how do typists know where the keys are on the QWERTY keyboard? 2.3.2 What are the alternatives? Typists have an internal cognitive spatial map of the keyboard that they use to guide their fingers during typing Typists do not have a map-like representation, instead they rely on learned associations between cues such as the feel of the keyboard to guide their fingers during typing 2.3.3 What is the logic? If typists have an internal map of the keyboard, then they should be able guide their fingers to correct locations based on the map alone, and no feedback from the environment. For example, if we could measure “air-typing” without a keyboard, then typists should still be able to put their fingers in the correct locations even when the keyboard is missing because they are relying on their internal map. If typists do not use an internal map of the keyboard, then their finger movements should become slow and inaccurate when they try to type without a keyboard, or in other conditions that change the normal feel of the keyboard, and thereby remove the cues that typists use to direct their fingers. 2.3.4 What is the Method? Typists copied paragraphs in four conditions that manipulated tactile (touching) feedback from the keyboard. They typed on a normal keyboard, a keyboard with the keys removed exposing the rubber buttons underneath, a flat circuit board without, and on a flat table with a laser projection keyboard. 2.3.5 Results Typists were fast and accurate in the normal keyboard condition. Typists were slow and inaccurate in all of the other keyboard conditions, where normal tactile feedback was removed. 2.3.6 Inference The results are not consistent with the internal map hypothesis. If typists had an internal map, and did not rely on tactile cues, then they should have typed normally even when the cues were removed. The results are consistent with learned association hypothesis, that typists rely on cues, like the feel of the keyboard, that are associated with particular key locations. 2.4 Finding the QALMRI sections in a journal article Most psychology journal articles are in APA format. See the textbook, and the sections about APA style in this lab manual for more on that format. APA format makes it relatively easy to find the sections of the QALMRI. The basic parts of an APA manuscript are Title - Offers clues about the big idea and finding Abstract - Usually a useful summary of the whole research. Introduction - Big questions are usually near the beginning, specific questions are usually in the middle. Alternatives (or Hypotheses) and Logic are usually just before the Experiment, and sometimes in the short introduction to the experiment. Methods - a whole section devoted to the M part Results - a whole section devoted to the R part Discussion - Usually provides a summary of the main important finding right at the beginning General Discussion - Should connect the main finding to the hypotheses and questions under investigation Most articles that are not in APA style also have very similar sections, and you should find the answers to the QALMRI in the same places. Some journals like Science and Nature have the method sections at the very end. Also, some journals have short article formats, where the research is presented in one or two pages. Oftentimes short reports do not have headers; nevertheless, the answers to the QAL parts are usually near the beginning and middle, and the answers to the RMI parts are usually near the end. To get some practice extracting QALMRI from a journal article, let’s look at short report published in Science. We’ll look at the Mehl et al. (2007) Mehl et al. (2007) paper, discussed in chapter 1 of the textbook. It’s only one page long, so it’s an easy read. Click this link to get the paper online. Note, if you are on the Brooklyn College network, this should take you directly to the paper. If you are at home, you will need to first sign into the library. 2.4.1 Finding the Big Question You might say the big question is implied by first sentence, “Sex differences in conversational behavior have long been a topic of public and scientific interest”. The big question is not stated directly, but you could infer that the questions are something like, 1) Are there sex differences in talking, or other conversational behavior?, 2) Do women talk more than men?, 3) Why do women talk more than men?, and so on. You might also read this article and conclude that the authors did not really spell out the big questions. After all, they only had a single page to communicate their research. So, it is important to realize that there are big questions that may not actually be stated. You, the reader, need to connect the dots. For example, we could say some of the really big questions are: 1) What are the main sex differences in communication, language, and cognition in general, 2) How do people use language to communicate, 3) What cognitive, biological, genetic, and environmental mechanisms cause sex differences in these behaviors? You can see that the research relates to these bigger questions, even if they are not explicitly stated. 2.4.2 Finding the Specific question In this case, the specific question is hard to miss. It’s in the title, “Are women really more talkative than men?”. The authors motivate asking this question by pointing out that systematic research has not actually measured how many words men and women say on average per day. 2.4.3 Alternatives The hypotheses in this article are pretty straightforward because they are clearly related to an empirical question. One hypothesis is alluded to in the second sentence, where the authors claim that western society has a stereotype that women are more talkative than men. In this case, the hypotheses in question are not about psychological processes or mechanisms, they are simply about the data. The authors also do not formally state two hypotheses. We have to do that for them. Hypothesis 1: Women are more talkative than men Hypothesis 2: Women are not more talkative than men 2.4.4 Logic In this case, the logic of the hypotheses is nearly identical to the hypotheses themselves, but simply stated in terms of a logical if/then structure. If, women are more talkative than men, then women should on average produce more words per day than men If, women are not more talkative than men, then women should on average produce the same or less number of words per day than men. 2.4.5 Methods You can see the methods described in paragraphs three and four. Basically, they recorded subjects all day long in their natural environments, and then counted how many words they said. 2.4.6 Results The results are in paragraph six, and presented in the table. You already know the question: “Do women talk more than men?”, and that they measured the number of words spoken by groups of men and women, so you should expect to find some average data showing the actual counts. We see this in the weighted average in the table. Women said on average 16,215 words per day, and men said 15,669 words per day. The results section says that this result was not statistically different, and could have easily been produced by chance. You can even see that some of the sub-groups showed the opposite pattern of data, with men saying more words per day than women. 2.4.7 Inference The authors make inferences about their hypotheses in the last two paragraphs. Their major inference is that, contrary to popular belief, women are not more talkative than men. They also discuss some limitations of their work. 2.4.8 Reading between the lines We saw that some parts of the QALMRI weren’t explicitly stated the by authors in the manuscript. However, all of the major parts were implied by what they wrote. This will be a common theme in reading the research literature. You will have to extract the implications when they are not explicitly stated. That means you have to read between the lines to understand the ideas and connections between them. This research appeared to have no theory behind it. So, the results of the paper did not appear to test predictions of any theory. Instead, the results were testing the popular claim or stereotype that women talk more than men. The data show strong, reliable evidence that this claim simply isn’t true, at least for the subjects they measured. But, do the data have implications beyond testing the stereotype? Do these data have theoretical implications? Yes, they do, but you have to read between the lines to see the connection. The author’s allude to this connection in the final paragraph, where they say “Further, to the extent that sex differences in daily word use are assumed to be biologically based, evolved adaptations [3], they should be detectable among university students as much as in more diverse samples”. The clue is the reference to [3], which you can find in the article, and refers to a book called “The Female Brain”. I have not read this book, but let’s imagine that it contains a theory about evolved adaptations that are biologically based, which cause differences in how women and men talk. This theory would make a number of assumptions, and it would predict that women talk more than men. So, even though the authors do not describe this theory in detail to explain how it works, and why it might predict that women talk more than men, their data nevertheless has implications for that theory. Specifically, any data showing that women and men say about the same numbers of words per day, has implications for any theory that predicts otherwise. So, reading between the lines, we can see that findings suggest that theories suggesting differences between women and men must be making wrong assumptions. And, the results point us toward theories that suggest common psychological principles and processes driven male and female talking behavior. So, indeed there are many implications between the lines that we arrive at when we draw them out of the text by thinking about the ideas, and the connections between ideas and the data. 2.5 The Hardest Section of the QALRMI: Alternatives In my opinion, the alternatives section is the hardest, and sometimes the most confusing part to extract from a journal article. Sometimes the author’s make it really easy by writing very clearly and explicitly. For example, you may find that the authors explicitly define two hypotheses, which is very helpful. But, this is not always the case. So, when there is only one hypothesis, don’t spend time looking in the manuscript for a second one (however, just because the authors didn’t generate a second hypothesis, doesn’t mean that you can’t do that for yourself. There’s always an alternative way of explaining things.) The alternatives section appears to be simple when the claim that is being tested is an empirical claim. Empirical claims are questions about whether the observations or measurements (dependent variables) are different between the conditions of the experiment (independent variables). There are always two general possibilities. There is a difference between conditions. There is no difference between conditions (like in the above paper, there were no differences between women and men in the number of words spoken per day) So, you might come across articles where the paper is asking whether one thing influences another. For example, does the color of a room (red vs. blue) change how fast you can read; or does drinking coffee vs. tea change how quickly you can learn piano. There are many “does this do something to that” kind of questions. In these cases, the alternative section boils down to: Empirical Hypothesis 1: X does change something in Y (This does do something to that) Empirical Hypothesis 2: X does not change something in Y (This does nothing to that) 2.5.1 Empirical vs. Theoretical Hypotheses Notice the new label “Empirical hypothesis”. This label means that the hypothesis is directly concerned with whether the experiment will do something, that is whether the manipulation will actually change something that was measured, or will do nothing at all. In fact, we might make a new label that eliminates the word hypothesis, because these two statements aren’t really hypotheses in any interesting sense, instead they just the two possible outcomes that can always occur in any experiment. So, let’s use the labels “Empirical Outcome” Empirical Outcome 1: X does change something in Y (This does do something to that) Empirical Outcome 2: X does not change something in Y (This does nothing to that) You should be able to see by now that there are always two outcomes when running an experiment. It does something (produces some difference), or it does nothing (produces no differences). So, for every experiment, you could always write an “Alternative”section that simply says the alternatives were 1) the experiment will do something, or 2) the experiment will not do anything. But, because this is true of all experiments, it really does not tell us anything useful. Instead, what you should be looking for is the “THEORETICAL HYPOTHESIS” or “THEORETICAL HYPOTHESES”. The theoretical hypotheses are where the alternative sections get really interesting, but at the same time can be very challenging to understand. Theoretical hypotheses can be challenging to understand because you have to understand what the theory is, how it works, and why it makes particular hypotheses. Most important are the connections between the theoretical hypotheses and the research findings. In particular, when a theoretical hypothesis fails to predict the research findings, the hypothesis must be somehow wrong! So, we can use the findings from experiments to rule out bad theories or explanations, which opens the door to new and improved theories that can explain the findings. Returning the “read between the lines” theme, not all papers will be explicit about the difference between theoretical hypotheses and empirical hypotheses. For example, look back at our QALMRI summary for the Mehl et al. (2007) paper. What kind of Alternatives did we list? It should be clear that we listed two empirical hypotheses: Either women talk more than men, or they don’t. Also, reading the paper, the authors’ themselves were mainly concerned with the empirical question, and only alluded to the theoretical issues in passing at the end of the article. So, when you are writing QALMRI summaries be aware that some papers fail to state the theoretical issues. When this is the case it is totally appropriate to state the Alternatives in terms of the Empirical hypotheses, as perhaps the authors were not testing any theories, or have no theoretical explanations for their results. You could also attempt to figure out what the theoretical issues might be by reading between the lines. However, when the article discusses the theories that motivate the research, you must state the alternatives in terms of the Theoretical hypotheses, because in these cases they are the most important parts of the paper. Finally, let’s consider how we could change the Alternatives section that we wrote for the Mehl et al. (2007) paper, so that rather than listing empirical hypotheses, we instead imagine what the theoretical hypotheses might be. The original empirical hypotheses were: Empirical Hypothesis 1: Women are more talkative than men Empirical Hypothesis 2: Women are not more talkative than men Some possible theoretical hypotheses are: Theoretical Hypothesis 1: Women and men have specific biological adaptations stemming from different evolutionary pressures that cause women to be more social than men. The implication is that women may exhibit more social behaviors, such as talking, than men. Theoretical Hypothesis 2: The neuro-biological and cognitive processes involved in language production are virtually identical between the sexes. The implication is that talking behaviors are not fundamentally different between men and women. To make the distinction and relationship between theoretical and empirical hypotheses more clear, we can put the empirical hypotheses inside the theoretical ones. Theoretical Hypothesis 1: Women and men have specific biological adaptations stemming from different evolutionary pressures that cause women to be more social than men. The implication is that women may exhibit more social behaviors, such as talking, than men. Empirical Hypothesis 1: Women are more talkative than men Theoretical Hypothesis 2: The neuro-biological and cognitive processes involved in language production are virtually identical between the sexes. The implication is that talking behaviors are not fundamentally different between men and women. Empirical Hypothesis 2: Women are not more talkative than men Each theoretical hypothesis implies particular empirical outcomes. So, we collect the data about the empirical outcomes because they test the implications of the theoretical hypotheses. References "],

A replication of the experiment has already been designed. To collect data, you will first participate as a subject in the experiment. Then, as a class you will be introduced to the published paper. You will read the paper and it in class. Then, the class will analyze the collected data to determine whether or not the major effects of interest have been replicated. Data will be collected using pen and paper methods, and analyzed by computer software. Each student will write a 5+ page, APA style report on the project. 3.2 Things you will learn Reading and citing primary source material Writing a brief APA style research report Conducting and reporting T-tests 3.3 Background readings To be provided by Lab Instructor 3.4 Grade 10% of final grade Graded by your lab instructor. Lab instructor sets due date, and determines whether revised drafts are submittable. If you submit completed versions of all paper assignments (1, 2, and 3), then you get to drop your lowest paper grade from paper 1 or 2. Specifically, you will receive your highest grade from paper 1 or 2 for both papers, thereby eliminating the lower grade. This allows room to learn and improve as you go. 3.5 Writing the paper There are many resources for help on writing an APA style research report in the lab manual, on the textbook, and the website. Check them out. As well, here is a rough roadmap for writing paper 1. 3.5.1 APA formatting, Title and Abstract Use APA formatting rules. Create a suitable title for the paper Write the abstract : No more than 250 words. The aim is to briefly describe the issue at hand, the experiment, and the results. 3.5.2 Introduction (around 2 double-spaced pages) The goal of the introduction is to first put the research into a broader context, and then narrow the focus to describe the specific research aims. A. Opening section: (starting broad) about 1 paragraph Discuss a real-world example of the general phenomena under investigation by the paper Tell the reader that the purpose of the current experiment is to conduct a replication of the work in question Establish the domain and big questions. Middle section: Prior work Discuss some examples of previous research that are similar to the present research. You have an opportunity here to look this kind of research up on Google Scholar. One or two examples ought to be enough. Explain the specific question that is being asked in this replication work.

There are lots of details that you can include, some of these are listed below. Be brief and concise Participants how many people? where did they come from? Materials what were the stimuli? how were they organized? Design &amp; Procedure What was the design What were the independent variable(s) What was the dependent variable Within or between subjects? How were the stimuli for each trial chosen Describe the steps each participant took to complete the experiment 3.5.4 Results The result section is used to report the patterns in the data, and the statistical support for those patterns. You will compute the results using SPSS in the lab computers. The lab manual can be consulted for help on running statistical tests, and for reporting results. Describe the statistical analysis Tell the reader where they can see the data. E.g., the results of experiment 1 are presented in table 1, or in figure 1 Make a table or figure to display the data in your paper Report the statistical test, and the pattern of the means. 3.5.5 Discussion The discussion can be used to briefly restate verbally the pattern of the most important results, and then to relate the results to theory and ideas developed in the introduction Highlight the main findings from the experiment Discuss how the data can be explained by the hypothesis. What inferences do you make about the hypotheses based on the research findings? Broaden your discussion. Can the findings be explained by an alternative theory? What can be generalized to the real world? Are there important confounds that prevent us from interpreting our results? 3.5.6 References and Figures or Tables Include citations used in the paper using APA style format Include a figure or table to show the results 3.6 Data-analysis tips In lab one you will be collecting measurements on several dependent variables, in each of two manipulated conditions (the independent variable). For each dependent variable you will want to determine whether the manipulation had an effect. That is, did the independent variable cause a change in the dependent variable. We know that differences can sometimes be observed by chance alone, so we want to conduct an inferential statistical test to determine the probability that our observed difference could have been produced by chance alone. To do this we will be conducting several t-tests. This is a short primer on the process. You can conduct t-tests in the software of your choice, or by hand using a calculator (or in excel). Here, we will use the free and open-source statistical package called R, to illustrate the process. You can also look at the examples of conducting t-tests in software using the lab manual from PSYC 3400 Introductory Statistics, and refresh your understanding of t-tests by reading the t-test chapter from the PSYC 3400 textbook. Let’s imagine we have two groups of 10 subjects each. Group A receives condition 1 of the independent variable, and Group B recieves condition 2 of the independent variable. We then measure some behavior for all of the subject in all of the groups. To make this more concrete, let’s say 10 subjects drink coffee, and the the 10 subjects drink tea. Then we present all of the subjects with a piece of art and ask them rate how beautiful they think it is on a scale from 1 to 7. When we collect all the data we should have 20 total ratings, one for each subject in each group. For example, if you put the data in a table it might look something like the following. Note, the grey text box shows the R code used to simulate the data. For, each group, we sample 10 numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 4, and a standard deviation of .5. Then we put the numbers in a table. coffee&lt;-round(rnorm(10,4,.5)) tea&lt;-round(rnorm(10,4,.5)) all_data&lt;-data.frame(coffee,tea) knitr::kable(all_data) coffee tea 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 3 4 6 4 5 4 5 We can do some quick descriptive statistics, for example, we might want to know the means of the beauty ratings for the coffee and tea groups. mean(coffee) ## [1] 4 mean(tea) ## [1] 4.2 The means aren’t very different, and of course we should expect they should be similar. After all, we sampled these means from the exact same distribution. So, we should expect that on average, the means should both be close to 4. However, they won’t necessarilly be exactly 4, because of variability introduced by random sampling. 3.6.1 The t-test What we want to do next is conduct an independent samples t-test. We want to determine whether any possible difference between the coffee and tea groups could have been produced by chance alone. We can conduct a t-test in R very easily using the t.test function. t.test(coffee,tea,var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: coffee and tea ## t = -0.68825, df = 18, p-value = 0.5001 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.8105138 0.4105138 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 4.0 4.2 R gives us back the t values, the degrees of freedom (df), and the associated p-value. The p-value tells us the likelihood that our difference, or a difference greater than the one we observed could have been produced by chance. 3.6.2 One more time Let’s try this whole process again, but this time we will simulate data with an actual difference between the groups. For example, let’s say we want to simulate the idea that drinking coffee makes people think the art is less beautiful by at least 2 points, and then reconduct the t-test with the new simulated data. We will sample numbers from a normal distribution with mean 3 for the coffee group, and mean 5 for the tea group (for an average expected difference of 2). coffee&lt;-round(rnorm(10,3,.5)) tea&lt;-round(rnorm(10,5,.5)) all_data&lt;-data.frame(coffee,tea) knitr::kable(all_data) coffee tea 4 5 3 5 3 6 2 5 3 5 3 4 3 5 3 5 2 5 4 5 mean(coffee) ## [1] 3 mean(tea) ## [1] 5 t.test(coffee,tea,var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: coffee and tea ## t = -7.746, df = 18, p-value = 3.868e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.542456 -1.457544 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 3 5 3.7 Writing up the results of a t-test We’ve now conducted two different t-tests, and received different results on each them. You will likely find different results for all of the t-tests that you conduct for the lab experiment. However, you will use the basic sentence structure to report all of the results. When you report the results of your experiment along with statistical tests there are two important features to include, the pattern of the results, and the inferential statistic. In this situation, we would simply report the means and the t-test information. Here are is an with made-up numbers. The coffee group gave a lower mean beauty rating (M = 3.4) than the tea group (M = 5.6), and the difference was significant, t (18) = 5.4, p &lt; .001. So, just in one sentence we tell the reader what the means were in both conditions, as whether the result was significant. APA style recommends reporting exact p-values when they are greater than .001 (for example p = .047). If the p-value is less than .001, then you just need to report p &lt; .001. "],
["miniproject-one-memory.html", "Chapter 4 MiniProject ONE (MEMORY) 4.1 What’s in store 4.2 Data-analysis tips 4.3 Writing it all up", " Chapter 4 MiniProject ONE (MEMORY) In the first mini-project, you will read, summarize and discuss the paper by Nairne, Pandeirada, and Thompson (2008). Then, you will attempt to replicate their results in the lab, by conducting an experiment and analyzing the data. 4.1 What’s in store Students read paper and write QALMRI (15-20) Group discussion about paper (15-20) Students attempt to replicate the major findings in the paper Break into four-five groups, each group assigned an encoding condition (Survival, Pleasantness, Imagery, Self-reference, Intentional learning) Each group picks their own 30 words. Can follow same procedure as in paper by choosing 30 words from Van Overschelde, Rawson, and Dunlosky (2004). Groups try to run at least 10 participants in their condition, recording proportion of correctly recalled words Groups enter their collected data into the master spreadsheet, which is given back to groups upon data completion Discussion of how to analyze the data Group attempt to analyze the data using t-tests and one-way ANOVA to determine if the survival framing produced better recall than the other conditions. 4.2 Data-analysis tips In this mini-lab, you will be determining whether different kinds of manipulations improve your ability to recall lists of words. Each condition different subjects will read a list a words, and then recall as many as they can on a sheet of paper. Then, you will measure recall for each subject by counting the number of correctly recalled words. You will try to get at least 10 subjects in each condition, the more the merrier. The empirical question will be whether memory recall is differs across the conditions. If they do differ, then some of those conditions help you remember words better, and some conditions may hurt your ability to remember words. With these kinds of experiments, we can learn about the factors that influence our memory, as well as how cognitive processes allow us to encode and retrieve memories. The new tool you be using here is a one-way ANOVA, which you may remember from your statistics classes. In particular, we will be performing an independent samples ANOVA, because we are conducting a between-subjects experiment, where different subjects contribute data in each of the conditions. More specifically, we will be conducting an omni-bus test. The omni-bus test is a catch-all test, that let’s us enter the data from as many conditions as we want, and ask the general question: are any of the conditions different from one another. This is different from a t-test, which only let’s us make a comparison between two conditions. In fact, the t-test and ANOVA are related, but this is a topic that we will leave for now. Except to say, that if you ran a t-test comparing two groups, or an ANOVA with only two groups, they would return the same p-values, because they are testing the same underlying question…which is the likelihood the observed occurs by chance alone. One drawback about the ANOVA, is that it only tells us if there is some difference, any difference, among the conditions we are comparing. But, it does not tell us which specific conditions are different. Fortunately, after we conduct the ANOVA, we can run follow-up t-tests comparing any groups we want. We can also conduct more complex comparisons using linear contrasts, but that is a topic for another day as well. We will again use to R to simulate a memory recall experiment with multiple conditions. Then, we will create fake data, plot the data, then analyze the data for differences using an ANOVA and follow-up tests. 4.2.1 Simulating the data Consider an experiment with five different memorizing conditions. This will be a between-subjects experiment with 10 simulated subjects in each condition. We will have condition A, B, C, D, and E. To simulate data for each subject we need to make some assumptions. Let’s that out of 30 words most people remember about 15 of them, but there is variation, so some people do better and some people do worse. We can model this by sampling numbers randomly from a distribution of our choice. For convenience, we will use the normal distribution, which looks like bell-curve (should be familiar from statistics class). Let’s imagine that condition A and B help memory more than C and D, and that memory is worse in condition E. Take a look at the code and output for simulating this kind of data. A&lt;-round(rnorm(10,20,2)) B&lt;-round(rnorm(10,20,2)) C&lt;-round(rnorm(10,15,2)) D&lt;-round(rnorm(10,15,2)) E&lt;-round(rnorm(10,10,2)) all_data&lt;-data.frame(A,B,C,D,E) knitr::kable(all_data) A B C D E 19 20 15 13 13 20 25 15 14 11 19 22 17 14 12 19 22 19 20 11 19 17 13 16 12 22 21 13 17 12 19 19 14 11 9 19 23 14 12 15 18 22 15 18 10 21 22 15 14 13 We have produced a table with fake data for 10 subjects in each condition. The numbers all represent the number of correctly recalled words for each simulated subject. For groups A and B we sample 10 numbers, from a distribution with mean 20, and standard deviation 2. This is a higher mean than groups C and D (mean = 15). The lowest mean was for Group E (mean = 10). So, on average, groups A and B should have higher scores than C and D, which should be higher than E. Ok, so what happened in our simulated experiment. We can see the numbers in the table, but it would be nice to summarize them so we can more easily look at differences. After all, it’s hard to make sense of a bunch of raw data in a table. One way to summarize the data is to compute the group means for each condition. This averages over the subjects, and gives us only 5 means to look at, so it is easier to see the differences. We can “easily” do this in R in a couple different ways. However, R often likes the data in a particular format, in this case long-data format. So, we will first convert to that format, and see what it looks like. long_data&lt;-data.frame(Conditions=rep(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;),each=10), Recall=c(A,B,C,D,E)) knitr::kable(long_data[1:25,]) Conditions Recall A 19 A 20 A 19 A 19 A 19 A 22 A 19 A 19 A 18 A 21 B 20 B 25 B 22 B 22 B 17 B 21 B 19 B 23 B 22 B 22 C 15 C 15 C 17 C 19 C 13 I’ve only printed the first 25 lines, but the dataframe contains all of the data for conditions, C, D, and E as well. You can see why they call it long format. It’s because each data point gets it’s own row in the table. 4.2.2 Looking at the means Now that the data is in long format we can easily make a table of the condition means condition_means&lt;-aggregate(Recall~Conditions,long_data,mean) knitr::kable(condition_means) Conditions Recall A 19.5 B 21.3 C 15.0 D 14.9 E 11.8 We can now see the group means, but we can’t see any measure of how variable the data are in each condition. We might, for example, also want to compute the standard deviation as well as the mean, and put them both in the table. We could run the same code from above and substite sd for mean, which would give us a table of standard deviations. However, we will use a more advanced function from the plyr package, called ddply. ddply let’s you compute multiple statistics and put them all in a single table. The syntax is a bit different, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it. library(plyr) condition_means&lt;-ddply(long_data,.(Conditions),summarise, MeanRecall=mean(Recall), StdDeviation=sd(Recall)) knitr::kable(condition_means) Conditions MeanRecall StdDeviation A 19.5 1.178511 B 21.3 2.213594 C 15.0 1.825742 D 14.9 2.806738 E 11.8 1.686548 4.2.3 Plotting the data It’s often very desirable to plot the data in a graph, rather than just present the means in a table. People find it easier to look at graphs, because the differences in the data just pop-out much easier than looking at numbers in a table. R has a fantastic graphing package called ggplot2. ggplot2 is a whole philosophy for visual design and data-presentation, and it can be daunting at first. But, it’s complexity makes it very powerful, and when you get the hang of it you can very quickly make all sorts of beautiful graphs to present data. Here is some code to make ggplot create a bar graph to plot the means, along with error bars. In this case the error bars with represent standard errors of the mean, rather than standard deviations. R does not have a built in function for the standard error of the mean, so we have to write it ourselves. library(ggplot2) sde&lt;-function(x){sd(x)/length(x)} plot_means&lt;-ddply(long_data,.(Conditions),summarise, MeanRecall=mean(Recall), SE=sde(Recall)) limits &lt;- aes(ymax = MeanRecall + SE, ymin = MeanRecall - SE) ggplot(plot_means,aes(x=Conditions, y=MeanRecall))+ geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;,stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ geom_errorbar(limits, width=.1)+ theme_classic(base_size=12)+ ylab(&quot;Mean Correctly \\n Recalled Words&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Condition&quot;) Now it is easy to the differences between conditions. Just as we had hoped, Groups A and B appear to have recalled more words than Groups C and D, which remembered more words than group E. 4.2.4 Conducting the ANOVA Although the graph and the tabe show some clear differences in the means, we still want to find out the probability that this kind of finding occurs by chance alone. We can be confident in the differences when we know that they do not occur very often by chance alone. The first step is conduct a one-way ANOVA. This is very easy in R. You can also look at the examples of conducting one-factor ANOVAs in software using the lab manual from PSYC 3400 Introductory Statistics, and refresh your understanding of the ANOVA by reading the ANOVA chapter from the PSYC 3400 textbook. aov.out&lt;-aov(Recall~Conditions,long_data) We’re done! It’s only one line of code. However, we need a couple more to see the results. library(xtable) aov_summary&lt;-summary(aov.out) knitr::kable(xtable(aov_summary)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Conditions 4 589.4 147.350000 36.21382 0 Residuals 45 183.1 4.068889 NA NA The ANOVA table gives us a bunch of information. We will go into much greater detail about the meaning of each number in the table, but also assume for now that you are somewhat familiar with these ideas because you have already taken statistics, right? We are mainly interested in the p-value, which tells how often results like the ones we found can occur by chance. But, when we report the results of our ANOVA, we also provide additional information about the F-value, the degrees of freedom values, and the mean squared error term. The reason is that if you know these numbers, you can actually reconstruct all of the other numbers. The results of our ANOVA are significant. You could report this in a sentence like the following. The main effect of condition was significant, F(4, 45) = 36.21, MSE = 4.07, p &lt; .001. 4.2.5 Comparisons between conditions The p-value from above is much smaller than .05, which shows the difference between conditions in the data does not occur very often by chance alone. However, because we conducted an omni-bus test, we only know that there is some difference between conditions, but we do not know which specific conditions are different from one another. So, we have to conduct additional tests between specific conditions. There are multiple strategies for conducting these tests. For now, we will simply run t-tests between comparisons of interest. Remember, our data simulated the pattern that memory recall would be better for groups A and B, which would be better than groups C and D, which would better than group E. In other words A=B &gt; C=D &gt; E. We can confirm this pattern by conducting tests to see if it holds up. For example, how would we test the pattern A=B &gt; C=D &gt; E, all of the following comparisons need to be true, A = B A &gt; C A &gt; D B &gt; C B &gt; D C = D and, all of the conditions should be greater than E A &gt; E B &gt; E C &gt; E D &gt; E Let’s conduct a few of these tests, and then report the findings. library(broom) #conduct t-tests ab&lt;-tidy(t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)) ac&lt;-tidy(t.test(A,C,var.equal = TRUE)) cd&lt;-tidy(t.test(C,D,var.equal = TRUE)) de&lt;-tidy(t.test(D,E,var.equal = TRUE)) #put the results in a table alltests&lt;-rbind(ab,ac,cd,de) alltests&lt;-cbind(alltests,Comparison=c(&quot;AB&quot;,&quot;AC&quot;,&quot;CD&quot;,&quot;DE&quot;)) finaltable &lt;- subset(alltests, select = c(Comparison,estimate1,estimate2,statistic,p.value,parameter)) knitr::kable(finaltable) Comparison estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter AB 19.5 21.3 -2.2697893 0.0357435 18 AC 19.5 15.0 6.5484619 0.0000037 18 CD 15.0 14.9 0.0944443 0.9257996 18 DE 14.9 11.8 2.9937759 0.0077901 18 4.3 Writing it all up The following is an example results section for our hypothetical experiment. This could serve as a model for your own results section. The number of correctly recalled words for each subject in each condition were submitted to a one-way ANOVA, with memorization condition (A, B, C, D, and E) as the sole between-subjects factor. Mean recall scores in each condition are displayed in Figure 1. The main effect of memorization condition was significant, F(4, 45) = 36.21, MSE = 4.07, p &lt; .001. Figure 1 shows that Groups A and B had higher recall scores than Groups C and D, which had higher recall scores than Group E. This pattern was confirmed across four independent sample t-tests. Group A (M = 19.5) and Group B (M = 21.3) were not significantly different t(18) = -2.27, p =0.036. Group A recalled significantly more words than Group C (M = 15), t(18) = 6.55, p =0. Group C and Group D (M = 14.9) were not significantly different t(18) = 0.09, p =0.926. Finally, Group D recalled significantly more words than Group E (M = 11.8), t(18) = 2.99, p =0.008.

(2013). Then, you will attempt to replicate their results in the lab, by conducting an experiment and analyzing the data. 5.1 What’s in store Students read paper and write QALMRI (15-20) Group discussion about paper (15-20) Students download the task-switching program available from the website and individually complete the task. Individual students then enter their data in the master spreadsheet Discussion of how to analyze the data. Major analysis goals are: Was there a mixing cost? Compare pure lists to mixed lists Was there a switching cost? Compare switch vs. repeat trials in pure lists Did these effects depend on gender? Did the women have a smaller mixing cost than the men? Did the women have a smaller switching cost than the men? Students break into groups to analyze the data. 5.2 Critical Concepts 5.2.1 Multiple Dependent and Independent Variables In lab 5 we begin looking at more complex designs that involve multiple dependent or and independent variables. For example, we can look at the dependent variable of reaction time or error rate, which are our two difference measured variables. There are also three independent variables, including gender (male vs female), block (pure list vs. mixed list), and trial sequence (repeat trial vs. switch trial). 5.2.2 Main effects and interactions Throughout this course we will be talking a lot about main effects and interactions. Feel free to jump ahead in the textbook and learn more about them. Main effects refer to the influence of single independent variables. And, each independent variable always has one main effect. So, we could look at the main effect of gender, block, or trial sequence. The main effect is like conducting a one-way ANOVA on the variable of interest, collapsing over the other variables. For example, a main effect of trial sequence usually shows slower mean reaction times in the switch condition compared to the repeat condition. This is called the task-switching cost, or also the task-switching effect. Interactions occur when the effect of one independent variable depends on the levels of another independent variable. For example, if women actually multi-task better than men, then we should expect an interaction between gender and task-switching. Specifically, women should be better at task-switching than men. This would mean that women should have smaller task-switching costs (meaning they are unaffected by switching) compared to men (who should have bigger task-switching costs if they are more affected by switching). If women have smaller task switching costs than men, then the effect of task-switching independent variable (repeat vs. switch) will depend on the level of the gender variable (women vs. men), which is the definition of an interaction. 5.2.3 Manipulating an Effect Things get complicated when we add more dependent and independent variables, and it can be easy to lose track of what is going on in an experiment. Many experiments are conducted for the purpose of better understanding some phenomena. For example, researchers observe phenomena like the task-switching effect, they create theories to explain the phenomena, then they test their theories by running more experiments. A primary question is often to identify factors that manipulate, influence, or somehow change the phenomena of interest. We know that switching between tasks can hurt performance, and we measure this cost by calculating a switch cost, which is the difference in performance between switching conditions and repeating conditions. What kinds of factors would make this cost ? Perhaps extended practice, time of day, gender, personality, motivation, drug interventions, details of the task, and many other factors could make the normal cost get smaller. Many of these factors might also make the effect get larger. And, knowledge of what makes switching costs smaller or larger can be used to test theories, which need to explain how and why those factors cause switching costs to change. The Stoet et al. (2013) took this approach to determine if switch costs are smaller for men than women. Notice we have been talking about switch costs, which is the phenonemon and effect of interest. We have not been talking too much about the dependent variable of reaction times that we use to compute the switch costs. Remember that switch costs are computed as RT switch - RT repeat. 5.2.4 Reducing a two-factor design to a single-factor design using difference scores We can use the term switch cost as a convenient term to describe the effect of the switching variable on reaction times. We can also think of the switch cost as the dependent variable of interest, rather than the base reaction time scores. Thinking of the switch cost this way can change how you conceptualize the design. For example, how many independent variables are in a design testing whether women have smaller switch costs than men? The answer could be two or one, depending on how you think of the design. If we go with two, then the design involves the independent variables gender (women vs. men) and trial sequence (switch vs. repeat), and the dependent variable of reaction time. This design would have two main effects (effect of gender, and effect of switching), and one interaction (gender x switching). We would be mainly interested in the interaction. For example, women may have a smaller difference in mean reaction time between the switch and repeat conditions than men. We can reduce the design to a simple single-factor design. To do so, we create a new dependent variable called switch costs. For example, for each subject we compute the mean reaction in the switch and repeat condition. Then we calculate the switch costs (difference between switch and repeat) for each subject. Now, each subject has one switch cost, rather than two reaction times. Now, the design would have gender as the single independent variable, and switch costs as the dependent variable. To determine whether women have smaller costs than men would you could run a t-test comparing the switch-costs between conditions. In addition to this material below, you can also look at the examples of conducting factorial ANOVAs in software using the lab manual from PSYC 3400 Introductory Statistics, and refresh your understanding of factorial ANOVAs by reading the Factorial ANOVA chapter from the PSYC 3400 textbook. 5.3 Data-analysis tips To give you an idea about the analyses you will be performing, we will again create simulated data to mimic aspects of the experiment, and then go through the steps of performing the analysis. We will simulate data for the switching cost. Specifically, we will imagine that women have a smaller switching cost than men. The code below generates sample data for 10 women and 10 men, who each have mean reactions in the repeat and switch conditions. For women, the mean reaction times were 580 ms for repeat and 600 ms for switch sequences, for a total expected switch cost of 20 ms. For men, the mean reaction times were 580 ms for repeat and 650 ms for switch sequences, for a total expected switch cost of 70 ms. 5.3.1 Simulating the data women_switch &lt;-round(rnorm(10,600,20)) women_repeat &lt;-round(rnorm(10,580,20)) men_switch &lt;-round(rnorm(10,650,20)) men_repeat &lt;-round(rnorm(10,580,20)) all_data&lt;-data.frame(Subject=c(rep(seq(1,10,1),2), rep(seq(11,20,1),2)), Gender=rep(c(&quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;),each=20), Sequence=rep(rep(c(&quot;switch&quot;,&quot;repeat&quot;),each=10),2), RT=c(women_switch,women_repeat, men_switch,men_repeat)) knitr::kable(all_data) Subject Gender Sequence RT 1 Female switch 587 2 Female switch 582 3 Female switch 574 4 Female switch 601 5 Female switch 626 6 Female switch 576 7 Female switch 587 8 Female switch 592 9 Female switch 596 10 Female switch 577 1 Female repeat 596 2 Female repeat 574 3 Female repeat 531 4 Female repeat 596 5 Female repeat 542 6 Female repeat 604 7 Female repeat 569 8 Female repeat 565 9 Female repeat 602 10 Female repeat 556 11 Male switch 639 12 Male switch 689 13 Male switch 635 14 Male switch 655 15 Male switch 681 16 Male switch 654 17 Male switch 674 18 Male switch 658 19 Male switch 630 20 Male switch 645 11 Male repeat 553 12 Male repeat 564 13 Male repeat 573 14 Male repeat 567 15 Male repeat 561 16 Male repeat 580 17 Male repeat 581 18 Male repeat 563 19 Male repeat 619 20 Male repeat 544 5.3.2 Plotting the data We can plot the data at least two ways. See the bar and line graphs below. Note that the x-axis changes between graphs. library(ggplot2) library(plyr) sde&lt;-function(x){sd(x)/length(x)} plot_means&lt;-ddply(all_data,.(Gender,Sequence),summarise, MeanRT=mean(RT), SE=sde(RT)) limits &lt;- aes(ymax = MeanRT + SE, ymin = MeanRT - SE) ggplot(plot_means,aes(x=Gender, y=MeanRT, group=Sequence,fill=Sequence))+ geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;,stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ geom_errorbar(limits, width=.3,position=position_dodge(.9))+ theme_classic(base_size=12)+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(500,700))+ ylab(&quot;Mean RT&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Trial sequence&quot;) ggplot(plot_means,aes(x=Sequence, y=MeanRT, group=Gender,shape=Gender))+ geom_line()+ geom_point()+ geom_errorbar(limits, width=.2)+ theme_classic(base_size=12)+ ylab(&quot;Mean RT&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Trial sequence&quot;) The graphs show that the switch costs (difference between repeat and switch trials) is smaller for women and men. Which is good, because we are simulating the data with this outcome in mind. 5.3.3 Running the ANOVA The next step is to conduct an ANOVA. This design has two factors or independent variables, gender and trial sequence. The gender variable is between-subjects, and the trial sequence variable is within subjects. So, we will run a 2 (Gender: Female vs. Male) x 2 (trial sequence: Repeat vs. Switch) mixed design ANOVA with Gender as the betwen-subjects factor, and trial sequence as the within-subjects factor. library(broom) library(xtable) all_data$Subject&lt;-as.factor(all_data$Subject) aov.out&lt;-aov(RT~Gender*Sequence+Error(Subject/Sequence),all_data) aov_summary&lt;-summary(aov.out) knitr::kable(xtable(aov_summary)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Gender 1 9985.6 9985.6000 28.08757 0.0000488 Residuals 18 6399.3 355.5167 NA NA Sequence 1 25908.1 25908.1000 51.49976 0.0000011 Gender:Sequence 1 11971.6 11971.6000 23.79698 0.0001209 Residuals 18 9055.3 503.0722 NA NA mt&lt;-model.tables(aov.out,&quot;means&quot;) mt ## Tables of means ## Grand mean ## ## 597.45 ## ## Gender ## Gender ## Female Male ## 581.6 613.2 ## ## Sequence ## Sequence ## repeat switch ## 572.0 622.9 ## ## Gender:Sequence ## Sequence ## Gender repeat switch ## Female 573.5 589.8 ## Male 570.5 656.0 The above shows the ANOVA table and the means for the main effects and interaction. We also conduct t.test comparisons to look at the switch costs separately for men and women. FemaleT&lt;-t.test(RT~Sequence,all_data[all_data$Gender==&quot;Female&quot;,],paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE) MaleT&lt;-t.test(RT~Sequence,all_data[all_data$Gender==&quot;Male&quot;,],paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE) FemaleT ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: RT by Sequence ## t = -1.6548, df = 9, p-value = 0.1323 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -38.582344 5.982344 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -16.3 MaleT ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: RT by Sequence ## t = -8.3757, df = 9, p-value = 1.531e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -108.59235 -62.40765 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -85.5 5.4 Writing up the results The next step is to interpret the results and write them up. Here is an example write-up. The mean reaction times for each subject in trial sequence condition were submitted to a 2 (Gender: Female vs. Male) x 2 (trial sequence: Repeat vs. Switch) mixed design ANOVA with Gender as the betwen-subjects factor, and trial sequence as the within-subjects factor. Mean reaction times in each condition collapsed across subjects are displayed in Figure 1. The main effect of gender was significant, F(1, 18) = 28.09, MSE = 355.52, p &lt; 0. Women (582 ms) had faster mean reaction times than men (613 ms). The main effect of trials sequence was significant, F(1, 18) = 51.5, MSE = 503.07, p &lt; 0. Repeat trials (572) had faster mean reaction times than switch trials (623). Most important was the significant two-way interaction between gender and trial sequence, F(1, 18) = 23.8, MSE = 503.07, p &lt; 0. We interpreted the interaction further by conducting the following comparisons. Women showed a significant switch cost, t(9) = -1.65, p = 0.132, with faster mean reaction times for repeat (574) than switch (590) trials. Men also showed a significant switch cost, t(9) = -8.38, p = 0, with faster mean reaction times for repeat (570) than switch trials (656). The presence of an interaction indicates that the size of the switch cost for women was significantly smaller than the size of the switch cost for men. References "],

(2006). This paper provides some background about the Stroop effect, which is a classic measure of selective attention, and then shows one manipulation that effectively helps people overcome Stroop interference. Your task in this lab will be to replicate the Stroop effect in one condition, and then attempt to change the size of the effect (make larger or smaller) in another condition. 6.1 What’s in store Students read paper and write QALMRI (15-20) Group discussion about paper (15-20) Students instructed their task is create their own Stroop design and employ a manipulation that increases or decreases the size of the Stroop effect Students break into groups and conduct a Stroop experiment, measuring the size of the Stroop effect in a “normal” condition, and in their manipulated condition. Groups analyze conduct a 2x2 ANOVA to see if their interaction was significant 6.2 Some background on the Stroop effect The Stroop effect is a well-known and classic phenomena in experimental psychology. The effect was first reported by Stroop (1935). Several hundreds of Stroop experiments have been conducted since 1935, for a review see (MacLeod 1991). In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the color of words as fast as they can. The trick is that sometimes the color of the word is the same as the name of the word, and sometimes it is not. Here are some examples: Congruent trials occur when the color and word match. So, the correct answers for each of the congruent stimuli shown would be to say, red, green, blue and yello. Incongruent trials occur when the color and word mismatch. The correct answers for each of the incongruent stimuli would be: blue, yellow, red, green. The Stroop effect is an example of a well-known phenomena. What happens is that people are faster to name the color of the congruent items compared to the color of the incongruent items. This difference (incongruent reaction time - congruent reaction time) is called the Stroop effect. Many researchers argue that the Stroop effect measures something about selective attention, the ability to ignore distracting information. In this case, the target information that you need to pay attention to is the color, not the word. For each item, the word is potentially distracting, it is not information that you are supposed to respond to. However, it seems that most people can’t help but notice the word, and their performance in the color-naming task is subsequently influenced by the presence of the distracting word. People who are good at ignoring the distracting words should have small Stroop effects. They will ignore the word, and it won’t influence them very much for either congruent or incongruent trials. As a result, the difference in performance (the Stroop effect) should be fairly small (if you have “good” selective attention in this task). People who are bad at ignoring the distracting words should have big Stroop effects. They will not ignore the words, causing them to be relatively fast when the word helps, and relatively slow when the word mismatches. As a result, they will show a difference in performance between the incongruent and congruent conditions. If we take the size of the Stroop effect as a measure of selective attention, we can then start wondering what sorts of things improve selective attention (e.g., that make the Stroop effect smaller), and what kinds of things impair selective attention (e.g., make the Stroop effect bigger).

There are 3 major components. 2-3 minute individual presentation Individual APA research report 10 minute group presentation For your individual presentation you will have the opportunity to develop your own experimental idea. Following the individual presentations you will be divided into smaller groups, and will decide on a final experiment idea. Each group will be required to have their experimental design approved by the lab instructor. Once the experiment is approved data collection can begin. Your lab instructors will help you with your experimental design to ensure that your project is feasible given the constraints that you are working with. Every student in the group will be responsible for writing their own APA research report on the findings of the experiment conducted by the group. As well as the paper, each group will be responsible for a 10 minute presentation that explains the findings of the research. 8.2 Requirements The following applies for all aspects of the following assignments. The final project (or proposal for individual presentation) must be a factorial design with two manipulated independent variables. The project must identify an effect from the literature that can be measured by one of the independent variables. For example, the choice of effect could be the Stroop effect, in which case the first independent variable would be congruency (congruent vs. incongruent). The second independent variable will involve a manipulation intended to influence the size of the effect under investigation. The manipulation could be intended to increase the size of the effect relative to an established condition, or to decrease or eliminate the the effect. For example, in a Stroop experiment, the second independent variable could be word-size, and the empirical question could be whether the Stroop effect is larger when the words are printed in a large font, compared to when the words are printed in a smaller font. In other words, the design of the final project will attempt to produce an interaction effect. 8.3 2-3 minute individual presentation (5% of total grade) Every student is responsible for one 2-3 minute presentation that outlines their proposal for the final project. After the presentation, students will form groups, and the groups will decide on a particular proposal for the final project (from the presentations, or a new proposal) Each individual presentation at a minimum should accomplish the following: Describe the effect that will be studied Describe the proposed manipulation that will influence the effect Show the predicted results in a graph Explain the hypothesis or theory that would lead you to predict those results Presentations should be made in powerpoint. You are allowed to develop any kind of experiment that interests you. However, your experiment must involve a factorial design. 8.4 APA style research report (15% of total grade) Every student will be responsible for reporting the findings of their group experiment in an APA style research report. The paper should have a minimum of 5 pages, and should include an introduction, methods section, results section, discussion, and reference section. The paper should contain at least 3 citations to relevant papers from the psychological literature. The format of the paper will be identical to all of the previous labs. The paper is not a group assignment. Each student will write their own paper. 8.5 10 minute group presentation (5% of total grade) After data collection and data analysis has taken place, each group will be responsible for presenting their findings. The group presentation should last approximately 10 minutes. The group presentation should be shared amongst the members of the group, with each member responsible for presenting a section of the material. The following material should be covered in the presentation: Explain relevant background knowledge Explain the hypothesis under investigation Explain the proposed design of the experiment Explain the predicted findings of the experiment Explain the actual findings Discuss the meaning of the findings as they relate to the hypotheses under investigation.

They will want to know why you did the investigation, how you did it, what you found out, and whether your findings were significant and useful. Research reports usually follow a standard five-part format: (1) introduction, (2) methods, (3) results (4) discussion of results, and (5) conclusions and recommendations. 9.1 Introduction Here you explain briefly the purpose of your investigation. What problem did you address? Why did you address it? You will need to provide enough background to enable the reader to understand the problem being investigated. Sometimes the introduction also includes a “literature review” summarizing previous research addressing the same or a related problem. In many scientific disciplines, it is also conventional to present a hypothesis—a tentative “answer” to the question that your investigation will confirm or disconfirm. 9.2 Methods This is a “cookbook” section detailing how you did your investigation. It provides enough details so that other researchers could replicate your investigation. Usually, this section includes the following subsections: (a) research design, (b) apparatus and materials, and (c) procedures followed. 9.3 Results This section sometimes headed “Findings,” presents the empirical results of your investigation. Often, your findings are displayed in figures, tables, graphs, or charts that are referenced in the text. Even though the data are displayed in visuals, the text itself should also describe the most significant data. (Imagine that the figures are displayed on a view graph and that you are explaining them orally, using a pointer. Your written text should transcribe what you would say orally.) Your figures and tables must have sufficient information to stand along, including accurate titles and clear labels for all meaning-carrying features. 9.4 Discussion of results This is the main part of the report, the part that will be read with the most care by other professionals. Here you explain the significance of your findings by relating what you discovered to the problem you set out to investigate in your introduction. Did your investigation accomplish your purpose? Did it answer your questions? Did it confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis? Are you results useful? Why or why not? Did you discover information that you hadn’t anticipated? Was your research design appropriate? Did your investigation raise new questions? Are there implications from your results that need to be explored? The key to success in this section is to link your findings to the questions and problems raised in the introduction. 9.5 Conclusions and recommendations In this last section, you focus on the main things you learned from the investigation and, in some cases, on the practical applications of your investigation. If your investigation was a pure research project, this section can be a summary of your most important findings along with recommendations for further research. If your investigation was aimed at making a practical decision (for example, an engineering design decisions), here you recommend appropriate actions. What you say in this section depends on the context of your investigation and the expectations of your readers. 9.6 APA style The next sections provide information about APA style, and an example research report written in APA style. 9.7 APA style formatting 9.8 Sample APA report "],
